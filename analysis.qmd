Voting for the president of the United States often feels unpredictable, but there are many variables that influence each voter's choice that can foresee the outcome. Using March 2024 YouGov survey data from 1,559 U.S. adults, we estimate the proportion of votes Joe Biden will receive in the November election.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
poll_data <- tibble(biden = as.factor(c(rep("Yes", 655), 
                                        rep("No", 904)))) |> 
                slice_sample(prop = 1)
```
